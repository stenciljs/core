# Stencil Type Tests

This directory is used to test whether Stencil correctly interprets JSX types in a basic Stencil project. Feel free to enhance the `test.spec.ts` file with your own scenario or create a new file.

To run these tests, run the following from the root of the Stencil project:

```sh
npm run test.type-tests
```

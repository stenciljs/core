# styleurls-component

This file is in a custom location, set with `.dir` on the `docs-readme` OT and `overwriteExisting` set to `if-missing`.  It is a supplemental due to this test requiring the `readme` file to not exist so it will be created by the `docs-readme` output target.

When the test is run the `readme.md` should be created.

The content of that readme should match the content of the readme beside the component.

This is a regression test for the issue reported in stenciljs/core#6248.

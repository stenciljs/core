# styleurls-component

This file is in a custom location, set with `.dir` on the `docs-readme` OT and `overwriteExisting` set to `true`.

The content here above the 'auto-generation' comment _should be overwritten_. It is copied into place by the `copy-readme.js` script before the `build` is performed and is expected to be overwritten by the version located beside the component, which is checked into Git here for a static reference. If it is not overwritten, the test will fail, indicating an issue with the overwrite process.

This is a regression test for the issue reported in stenciljs/core#6248.
